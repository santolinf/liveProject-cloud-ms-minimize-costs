## Requirements

To use these microservices you need to have in your machine the following things:
- [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/ar/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Architecture

The microservices are an abstraction of all the flow of the flight’s team. These microservices only contain all endpoints related to searching.

#### Microservices

The system comprises the following microservices:
* **api-catalog** is a microservice containing all information about which are the valid cities to find flights. This API only returns a certain amount of flights that are required in the request, to get the next page of results without doing a new search, all the results will save it in a database with a TTL.
* **api-clusters** is a microservice containing all the validations about the parameters of the search. Also, call **api-pricing** to get the final price of each itinerary.
* **api-pricing** is a microservice containing all the rules to add a markup of each itinerary and calculate the final price of each of them.
* **api-itineraries-search** is a microservice containing all logic, of which providers need to call to get all the itineraries. Also, this microservice removes duplicates.
* **api-provider-alpha** is a microservice that simulates to get the information of an external provider.
* **api-provider-beta** is a microservice that simulates to get the information of an external provider.

The following picture illustrates the architecture described above.

### Layers

All the microservices are split in different layers which only have access to others layers. The following figure show you the common structure in all the microservices:

![Layers](.images/Microservices-Layers.png)

Now, a little about what contain each layer:

| Layer         | Description                                                                                                             | Packages                                              |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Controllers   | Contain all the endpoints and the documentation about the microservices                                                 | *.controller and *.controller.documentation           |
| Services      | Contain all the definition of the services and the implementation                                                       | *.service and *.service.impl                          |
| Validators    | Contain all the logic to validate a Request of a DTO                                                                    | *.validator                                           |
| Repositories  | This layer contain the definition using interfaces and in some cases contain the specification to do a particular query | *.repository, *.repository.impl, and *.specification  |
| Connectors    | Inside this layer there are all the configurations and the endpoints to communicate with external services.             | *.connector and *.connector.configuration             |
| Helpers       | All the classes that help in different things in the entire microservices (e.g calculate the duration of a flight)      | *.helper                                              |
| Configuration | All the logic to configure different aspects of the microservices (e.g format of the response, ports)                   | *.configuration                                       |
| Exceptions    | Contain all the exceptions that each microservice can throw during the execution of a request                           | *.exception                                           |
| Model         | This particular layer contain all the entities which access to the databases                                            | *.model                                               |
| Enums/DTO     | In this layer you can find the classes and the enum that are using across the different layers                          | *.enums and *.dto                                     |


#### Model

Most of the microservices use a common model of classes to prevent duplicate code in each of them exists a library [Flights Common DTO](https://github.com/andres-sacco/manning-twa-libs-dto).

The common model comprises the following group of classes/enums:
* **AvailabilityRequestDTO** - This class contains all the parameters uses to search.
* **Provider** - This enum contains all the providers (Alpha, Beta).
* **FlightType** - This enum contain all the flights types(One-way, Return).
* **PassengerType** - This enum contain all the passengers types.
* **ItineraryDTO** & **SegmentDTO**  & **LegDTO** - These classes have all the common information about one group of flights. Also contain a reference to the price.
* **PriceInfoDTO** - This class contains all the information about the price of all the types of passengers.
* **PaxPriceDTO** - This class refers to the price of one type of passenger.
* **MarkupDTO** - This class has all the information about the markup of one itinerary.

#### Flow

The flow of each request to search has the following steps:
1. API-Clusters receive a request and validate common information like the number of passengers and the distribution of them, the departure date, and some other information.
2. API-Clusters do a request of each city to validate the existence of that city.
3. API-Clusters do a request with all the information related to the search to API-Itineraries-search.
4. API-Itineraries-search find all the providers and do a request with the same information that they receive it.
5. Each provider gets all the itineraries that match the conditions of the request. Also, each provider does several requests to get the timezone of each city and with this information calculate the duration of each flight.
6. API-Clusters send all the itineraries to API-Pricing to get all the information about the markup of each flight and which is the final price.
7. API-Clusters save the entire responses for a brief period in the Redis database because the search is paginated, so API-Clusters use the database to prevent do the same search again just to get the next page the result.

The following picture illustrates the flow described above.

Also, you can see the flow with more detail in this picture:

#### Technologies

The microservices use some frameworks/libraries:
- **[spring-boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)** is a common framework to develop a Java application easily because most of the things have a simple configuration.
- **[springdoc-openapi](https://springdoc.org/)** is an implementation of the standard of Open API 3 to document the different endpoints of the microservices. Also, give you the chance to test each endpoint with some data of example.
- **[chaos-monkey](https://codecentric.github.io/chaos-monkey-spring-boot/)** is a library that simulate random problems in the microservices following the principles of **[Chaos Engineering](https://www.gremlin.com/community/tutorials/chaos-engineering-the-history-principles-and-practice/)** like latency, exceptions. The idea to use this tool is to help to the developers to simulate random problems in the different microservices in a simple way.
- **[orika](https://orika-mapper.github.io/orika-docs/)** is a library that helps to map the values from one object to another.
- **[snakeyaml](https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml/src/master/)** is a library to use YML files as resources in the different microservices.

#### Internal libraries

All the microservices have dependencies of internal libraries which reduce the number of line of code duplicated. If you want more information about each of them you can access to the repositories and download the code.
- **[flights-common-dto](https://github.com/andres-sacco/manning-twa-libs-dto)** is a library which contain all the domain model.
- **[flights-parent](https://github.com/andres-sacco/manning-twa-lib-parent)** is a library which contain all the configuration related with the plugins and some common properties.

## Run the APIs

To run API, please follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository using this command **git clone https://github.com/andres-sacco/manning-twa-api.git**
2. Open a terminal in the directory of the API and run **mvn clean install** this command compiles all the code and generates the jars. After doing that, run **docker-compose build** and  **docker-compose up** all the components run together.
3. If everything works fine, open a web browser in the URL which appears in the documentation section.

Another option is to open each project in the IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ) and run it. Take into consideration that the repository has a file **docker-compose-infrastructure.yml** which has the containers to run the databases that **Catalog** and **Pricing** uses to get the information, so compile and run this file before running all the microservices in your IDE. To run the infrastructure the commands change a little: **docker-compose -f docker-compose-infrastructure.yml build** and **docker-compose -f docker-compose-infrastructure.yml up**.

If you have any doubt about the status of the microservices, you can open another terminal in the root directory of the code and run **docker ps**, this command will show you which port the different container expose, the status (up, down), and the names.

Additionally to all this options there is [Makefile](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile) which you can run all the steps using one command **make start** (this represent the first 3 steps) or **make start-infra** to run only the infrastructure. To stop all the containers you can execute **make stop** or **make stop-infra**.

## Documentation of APIs

Each API has documentation to understand which parameters are required and the URL to invoke them. To see the API documentation is necessary to run each project and access to:
- [Swagger - Clusters](http://localhost:4070/api/flights/clusters/documentation)
- [Swagger - Pricing](http://localhost:5070/api/flights/pricing/documentation)
- [Swagger - Catalog](http://localhost:6070/api/flights/catalog/documentation)
- [Swagger - Itineraries Search](http://localhost:7070/api/flights/itineraries-search/documentation)
- [Swagger - Provider Alpha](http://localhost:8070/api/flights/provider/alpha/documentation)
- [Swagger - Provider Beta](http://localhost:9070/api/flights/provider/beta/documentation)

**Note:** Take into consideration that all the API has to GET methods except API-Pricing because this API needs to receive a list of Itineraries, so it’s not possible to use a GET method.

Optionally you can use [**Postman**](https://www.postman.com/) or [**Insomia**](https://insomnia.rest/) to do the request from the different microservices, the repository includes a collection of each tool with all the endpoints.

## Considerations

To run all the microservices in the same machine, you need to consider that the following ports need to be available to use it:

| Name                    | Application   | Http proxy             | Database <sup>*</sup> |
| -----------             | -----------   |------------------------|-----------------------|
| api-clusters            | 4070          | ---                    | 6079                  |
| api-pricing             | 5070          | ---                    | 5432 <sup>**</sup>    |
| api-catalog             | 6070          | 6078 <sup>&#134;</sup> | 5432 <sup>**</sup>    |
| api-itineraries-search  | 7070          | ---                    | ---                   |
| api-provider-alpha      | 8070          | ---                    | ---                   |
| api-provider-beta       | 9070          | ---                    | ---                   |

> **<sup>\*</sup>** PostgreSQL database is used instead of MySQL
> 
> **<sup>\*\*</sup>** one PostgreSQL server instance is used to host separate databases, hence the same database port number
> 
> **<sup>&#134;</sup>** Varnish - caching HTTP reverse proxy

Take into consideration that the port of the databases is only necessary when you run all the microservices in your IDE and use **docker-compose-infrastructure.yml** to run the databases. If you run all microservices using **docker-compose.yml**, you only check the ports of the **Application** column.
